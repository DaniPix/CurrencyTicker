# CurrencyTicker

Update a list of currencies against a base currency every 1 second.

MVVM(jetpack) approach in architecture with some logic offloaded on repositories (no usecases to handle data transformations, did it inside the repository)
Heavy use on Android jetpack libraries and some external libraries like retrofit and rxjava2 and testing libraries.
